Protractor
----------

Protractor is a **test framework built for Angular and AngularJS** applications that
is used for **end-to-end testing**. The framework simulates a person using the
web application by running a developer's tests on a real browser. It adds a
layer of tests to help ensure that newly added front-end code does not break
already existing functionality or the build itself.
